# Index Tracker

The index tracker module uses an `index.json` file.

The structure of the file is as follow:

```javascript
{
    "VIXEOD": {
        "interval": "1m",
        "endpoints": [
            {
                "URL": "https://www.quandl.com/api/v3/datasets/CHRIS/CBOE_VX1.json?api_key=${API_KEY}",
                "param": "$.dataset.data[0][4]"
            }
        ]
    },
    ...
    "AMPL/ETH": [
        "interval": "1m",
          "endpoints": [
              {
                "URL": "Mainnet:0xc5be99a02c6857f9eac67bbce58df5572498f40c,Rinkeby:0x7e62a502232f1feB77Adf8b8ca023cc9fB133418",
                "type": "ethereum",
                "parser": "Uniswap"
              }
          ]
    ],
    ...
}
```

Any env variable is substituted in the API URL. The example above uses `API_KEY` env variable.
This is needed as some API endpoints require api key to allows access or to increase API throtling.

## Index Tracker types

### HTTP trackers

If not set the default type of an index tracker is `http` type.

### On-chain trackers

If the index tracker type was set to `ethereum` then it's an on-chain tracker that fetches data using on-chain calls on an Ethereum blockchain network.

Currently supported on-chain parsers are `Uniswap` and `Balancer` parsers.


## Parsers

### Jsonpath parser

When not set this is the default parser. It parses data from the JSON payload using the `param` as an instruction on how to parse the output.
[More info](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).

### Balancer parser

`Balancer` is a parser that fetches tracker info from a [Balancer pool](https://docs.balancer.finance/getting-started/faq#balancer-pools). Balancer pools are liquidity pools for pair of ERC20 tokens. a Balancer pool could exist on both Ethereum mainnet and testnets. for Balancer smart contract addresses see [here](https://docs.balancer.finance/smart-contracts/addresses).

There is an `on-chain registry` smart contract for Balancer that could be queried to get the best pools for an input pair of ERC20 tokens:

```javascript
getBestPools(address fromToken, address destToken)
```

This method will retrieve an array of pool addresses for a token pair that is ordered by liquidity value.

Sometimes there is no deployed testnet Balancer pool to use in the On-chain index tracker. Here are some steps to deploy a Balancer pool on the Rinkeby testnet and add some liquidity to it based on [this](https://docs.balancer.finance/guides/testing-on-kovan) Balancer doc.

**1- Deploy ERC20 tokens as required**

[Here](https://github.com/hhio618/simple-erc20-example) is a simple JavaScript project that could be used to deploy an ERC20 token on the Rinkeby testnet.

**2- Install and configure the seth client**

Install and configure `seth` client using [this Github repository](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation) guides.

**3- Pool creation**

Set address variables:

```javascript
export BFACTORY=0x9C84391B443ea3a48788079a5f98e2EaD55c9309
export TOKEN1=<token#1-address-from-the-first-step>
export TOKEN2=<token#2-address-from-the-first-step>
```

Create a new pool:

```text
seth send --gas 5000000 $BFACTORY "newBPool()"
```

Set `BPOOL` variable:

```text
export BPOOL=0x... (address returned from the previous command)
```

Approve ERC20 tokens on the BPool smart contract:

```text
amount=$(seth --to-uint256 $(seth --to-wei 1000000 ether))
seth send $TOKEN1 "approve(address,uint256)" $BPOOL $amount
seth send $TOKEN2 "approve(address,uint256)" $BPOOL $amount
```

Wait for confirmations. after that bind tokens using the `bind` method. for example:

```text
# Bind 1000000 TOKEN1 with a denormalized weight of 5
amount=$(seth --to-uint256 $(seth --to-wei 1000000 ether))
weight=$(seth --to-uint256 $(seth --to-wei 5 ether))
seth send $BPOOL "bind(address, uint256, uint256)" $TOKEN1 $amount $weight
```

Let's confirm that all the tokens were added by using some query method:

```text
seth call $BPOOL "getNumTokens()"
```

Set a swap fee and finalize:

```text
fee=$(seth --to-uint256 $(seth --to-wei 0.003 ether))
seth send $BPOOL "setSwapFee(uint256)" $fee
seth send $BPOOL "finalize()"
```

All done. Let's confirm that we received BPTs by calling `balanceOf` directly on the pool address \(since the pools themselves are ERC20 tokens\):

```text
seth --from-wei $(seth --to-dec $(seth call $BPOOL "balanceOf(address)" $ETH_FROM))
```

### Uniswap parser

`Uniswap` is a parser that fetches tracker info from a [UniswapV2 pair](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contracts/pair/). the easiest way to add UniswapV2 testnet pair is to call the [addLiquidity](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contracts/router02/#addliquidity) contract method on Uniswap RouterV2 smart contract on different Ethereum networks. see [addresses](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contracts/router02/#addresshttps://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contracts/router02/#address). the method is as follow:

```javascript
function addLiquidity(
  address tokenA,
  address tokenB,
  uint amountADesired,
  uint amountBDesired,
  uint amountAMin,
  uint amountBMin,
  address to,
  uint deadline
) external returns (uint amountA, uint amountB, uint liquidity);
```

This required to deploy some ERC20 token beforehand and will create a Uniswap V2 pair if already not exists for the provided pair. there is a factory method that could be used to get the pair address [here](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contracts/factory/#getpair).
